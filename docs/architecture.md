# Threat Models and MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Tool Architecture

This document provides an overview of the architecture and design of the Threat Models and MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Tool.

## System Overview

The Threat Models and MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Tool is designed to automate the process of updating threat models and mapping them to the MITRE ATT&CK framework based on the latest threat intelligence data. The tool fetches data from various threat intelligence sources, including the MITRE ATT&CK API, AlienVault OTX, and VirusTotal, and uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to map observed threat behaviors to known attack techniques.

## Architecture Components

The system is organized into the following main components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Responsible for fetching data from various threat intelligence sources, normalizing it, and storing it in the database.
2. **Mapping**: Responsible for mapping threat data to MITRE ATT&CK techniques using machine learning and NLP.
3. **Visualization**: Responsible for creating interactive visualizations of the mapped threat data.
4. **Reporting**: Responsible for generating detailed reports in various formats.
5. **Integration**: Responsible for integrating with SIEM and SOAR platforms.

## Component Details

### 1. Data Ingestion

The data ingestion component is responsible for fetching data from various threat intelligence sources, normalizing it, and storing it in the database. It consists of the following modules:

- **consolidated_ingest_data.py**: Fetches data from MITRE ATT&CK, AlienVault OTX, and VirusTotal.
- **normalize_data.py**: Normalizes the fetched data into a consistent format.
- **store_data_in_db.py**: Stores the normalized data in the database.

#### Data Flow

1. Data is fetched from various sources using their respective APIs.
2. The fetched data is saved to JSON files in the `data/raw/` directory.
3. The raw data is normalized into a consistent format and saved to JSON files in the `data/processed/` directory.
4. The normalized data is stored in the database.

### 2. Mapping

The mapping component is responsible for mapping threat data to MITRE ATT&CK techniques using machine learning and NLP. It consists of the following module:

- **consolidated_mapping_algorithm.py**: Implements the mapping algorithm using machine learning and NLP techniques.

#### Mapping Process

1. A machine learning model is trained using the MITRE ATT&CK data.
2. The model is used to predict the most relevant MITRE ATT&CK technique for each threat.
3. The mappings are saved to a JSON file and stored in the database.

### 3. Visualization

The visualization component is responsible for creating interactive visualizations of the mapped threat data. It consists of the following module:

- **consolidated_dashboard.py**: Implements both static visualizations and an interactive dashboard.

#### Visualization Types

1. **Interactive Map**: Displays the geographic locations of threats.
2. **Threat Type Distribution**: Bar chart showing the distribution of threat types.
3. **Threats Over Time**: Line chart showing the number of threats over time.
4. **Interactive Dashboard**: Dash-based dashboard for exploring the data.

### 4. Reporting

The reporting component is responsible for generating detailed reports in various formats. It consists of the following module:

- **generate_reports.py**: Generates reports in HTML, PDF, CSV, and JSON formats.

#### Report Types

1. **HTML Report**: Interactive report with embedded visualizations.
2. **PDF Report**: Static report for printing and sharing.
3. **CSV Report**: Tabular data for further analysis.
4. **JSON Report**: Structured data for programmatic access.

### 5. Integration

The integration component is responsible for integrating with SIEM and SOAR platforms. It consists of the following modules:

- **siem_integration.py**: Integrates with SIEM platforms.
- **soar_integration.py**: Integrates with SOAR platforms.

## Data Model

The system uses the following database tables:

1. **mitre_attack_techniques**: Stores MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
2. **threat_intelligence_data**: Stores threat intelligence data.
3. **otx_data**: Stores AlienVault OTX data.
4. **virustotal_data**: Stores VirusTotal data.
5. **mapped_threat_data**: Stores mappings between threats and techniques.

## Workflow

The main workflow of the system is as follows:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Fetch data from various sources, normalize it, and store it in the database.
2. **Mapping**: Map threat data to MITRE ATT&CK techniques using machine learning and NLP.
3. **Visualization**: Create interactive visualizations of the mapped threat data.
4. **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports in various formats.
5. **Integration**: Integrate with SIEM and SOAR platforms for enhanced incident response.

## Configuration

The system is configured using a YAML file located at `config/settings.yaml`. This file contains settings for:

- API URLs and endpoints
- API keys
- File paths
- Database configuration
- Scheduling configuration
- Machine learning configuration
- Visualization configuration
- Reporting configuration

## Deployment

The system can be deployed as a standalone application or as a service. It can be run on a schedule to automatically update threat models and generate reports.

## Security Considerations

The system handles sensitive threat intelligence data, so security is a key consideration. The following security measures are implemented:

- API keys are stored in a configuration file that is not checked into version control.
- Database credentials are stored in a configuration file that is not checked into version control.
- All data is stored in a secure database.
- Access to the system is restricted to authorized users.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the system include:

1. **Additional Data Sources**: Integrate with additional threat intelligence sources.
2. **Advanced Machine Learning**: Implement more advanced machine learning techniques for mapping.
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Implement real-time processing of threat data.
4. **Enhanced Visualization**: Implement more advanced visualization techniques.
5. **Mobile Support**: Develop a mobile application for accessing the system.
